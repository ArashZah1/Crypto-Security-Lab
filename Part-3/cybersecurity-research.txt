On May 2014, Ebay had 145 Million users accounts exposed. This included names, addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords.  users were required to change their passwords after personal information was compromised in a large-scale data breach. It is believed that eBay was a victim of “phising” and “social engineering,” a practice used to discreetly convince employees to give up personal information and allow hackers to infiltrate a system. In order to avoid these scenarios, it is important to actively train employees to recognize scams and employ two-step verification where possible. Adding more steps to the verification process gives more security to user accounts.
